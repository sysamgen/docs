Data catalogue
-----------------------
All files defined as outputs in bioinformatics pipelines are stored in common place. Typically, these files include processed BAM, CRAM, VCFs and QC reports.

The structure is organized as follows. 

Top level category is analysis type (pipeline name). Under specific analysis outputs from many pipelines runs are stored. 
As each run has it's own unique name is used to create directories for saving pipeline's data.    
 
Naming convention follows the principle that each file name should contain sample identification (eg. sample name).
